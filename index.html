Explanation
Color Data Parsing: The colors are counted from a hardcoded source representing your table.
Color Frequency Calculations: Various calculations including most common (mean), median, and variance of the colors are
implemented using the Counter class from collections.
Database Connection: The PostgreSQL part requires psycopg2. Adjust your credentials as necessary.
Recursive Search Function: Defined to search for a target number in a list.
Random Number Generation: A function generates a random binary number and converts it to decimal.
